### Running the website locally
The easiest way to run the website is using a python server. If you have XAMPP or Apache installed on your system, you can use that as well.
We will assume you have python installed, if not install it here : https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

#### Linux
- Open terminal
- cd /path/to/SIRo-Lab-Web/
- python3 -m http.server 8000

#### Windows
- Open command prompt (cmd)
- cd path\to\SIRo-Lab-Web\
- python -m http.server 8000

This will serve the website on your pc. You can now access it using your web browser : http://localhost:8000
If you find an error regarding the port 8000 not being free, try other ports >8000.
